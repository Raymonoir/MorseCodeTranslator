# MorseCodeTranslator
This small pyton application will allow the user to input either plain text or morse code which will then be translated into the other. 

I have implemented a binary tree with each node storing a different character that can be translated, the binary tree can navigated by moving left if the next character in a morse code letter is a dot ( . ) and right if the next character is a dash ( - ). I then use this to translate text from morse to plain text and visa versa.
